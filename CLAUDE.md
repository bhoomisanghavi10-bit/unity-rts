# Project: Kingdoms of Bharat

Historical RTS across Indian kingdoms/empires, targeting AoE II/IV-level systemic
depth. Full roadmap: `/docs/ROADMAP.md` (Master Roadmap v3 — sections: 1. Open items
punch list, 2. Architectural notes to preserve, 3. Process note, 4. Art direction &
asset requirements, 5. Priority order).

## Current status (keep current — update every session)
- Working from Roadmap Section 5's priority order.
- Currently on: next unstarted item from Section 5 — item 2, "wire remaining per-civ
  passive bonuses live."
- Last completed: Section 5 item 1, training/trade UI batch (Cavalry, Siege, Dock,
  Spearman, Market) — see `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` for details. Along the way, the project
  also got its first `.asmdef` split (`KingdomsOfBharat.Runtime`/`.Editor`/`.Tests`) and
  first automated tests, since none existed before and were required to test the new
  training/trade paths.

## Engine & architecture
- Unity version: [fill in]
- Render pipeline: URP
- Networking: deterministic lockstep, foundational pass only — see Roadmap Section 1
  "Multiplayer determinism gaps" before touching anything network-related
- Data: civs/techs/units are CSV-driven → generated ScriptableObjects
  (`Assets/Design/Data/*.csv` → `Assets/Editor/CsvToScriptableObject.cs` →
  `Assets/Resources/Data/Generated/`, read via `Core/DataRegistry.cs`). Don't hand-edit
  generated assets — edit the CSV and regenerate.

## STRICT SESSION PROTOCOL
1. On start: read `/docs/ROADMAP.md` Section 5 and this file's "Current status." State
   the next item and confirm before starting.
2. One roadmap item per session. Flag adjacent work instead of silently expanding
   scope — ask whether to include it now or log it as a new item.
3. Plan Mode before nontrivial changes.
4. Test before calling it done.
5. Update Section 1/5 of the roadmap (check off/reorder) and this file's status.
6. Log to `/docs/SESSION_LOG.md`.
7. One scoped commit referencing the roadmap item.
8. Stop — don't roll into the next item without being asked.

## Known gotchas (from project history — read before hitting these again)
- **"Editor frame stuck at Time.time=0" flakiness has a real fix**: call
  `Application.runInBackground = true`, `EditorApplication.QueuePlayerLoopUpdate()`,
  and repaint SceneView + GameView together. Try this before falling back to
  reflection-forced ticks.
- **`CombatBonus` and `CounterMatrix` are deliberately separate systems** — don't
  merge them. `CombatBonus` holds playtested balance fixes (incl. the asymmetric
  Cavalry-vs-Archer split); `CounterMatrix` is CSV data used only for Spearman.
- **`AgeProfile`/`UpgradeProgress` are intentionally hardcoded**, not CSV-migrated —
  pure formula tuning, no natural per-row shape. Don't "finish the migration" onto
  these without a real schema design first.
- **Single-session discipline matters here specifically**: this project's own history
  has real bugs from concurrent sessions (a duplicated script folder, a silent
  colliding-enum-name bug, a git-index race) and from trusting peer-relayed claims
  instead of confirming directly. Run one session at a time. Treat any claim about
  "what was already done" as unverified until confirmed against the actual repo.
- **Asset sourcing/creation is NOT Claude Code's job right now.** Per Roadmap Section
  4, the user arranges or creates required assets against the spec there. Claude
  Code's role is wiring already-provided assets in (factories, attachment points,
  material tinting), not sourcing packs — the earlier ad hoc sourcing approach was
  explicitly rejected for not meeting the target visual standard.
- **The project now has real `.asmdef` assemblies** (added when the training/trade UI
  batch needed its first tests): `Assets/Scripts/KingdomsOfBharat.Runtime.asmdef` covers
  all of `Assets/Scripts`; `Assets/Editor/KingdomsOfBharat.Editor.asmdef` (references
  Runtime) covers `Assets/Editor`; `Assets/Tests/EditMode/KingdomsOfBharat.Tests.asmdef`
  (references Runtime + the Unity Test Framework) covers `Assets/Tests`. New runtime
  scripts anywhere under `Assets/Scripts` compile into Runtime automatically — no action
  needed. Third-party asset folders (RedCambala, Tree_Packs, PolishedSurfaces, the human
  character-pack demo scripts under `Assets/Resources/human/...`) were deliberately left
  out of this split (still compile into the implicit default assembly) since nothing in
  `Assets/Scripts` depends on them.

## Coding conventions
- Prefer ScriptableObjects / the CSV data pipeline for new unit/civ/tech content over
  hardcoded values, unless it falls into one of the "intentionally hardcoded" gotchas
  above.
- Every new system needs at least a basic PlayMode/EditMode test.
